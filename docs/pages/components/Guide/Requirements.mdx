### Requirements & Installation

import Accordion from "../../../components/utils/Accordion";

Before you start using **Princey UI**, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements. This guide will walk you through the installation process for both React and Next.js projects, with a recommendation to use Tailwind CSS for styling.

---

## 1. React or Next.js Project

Princey UI is compatible with both [react](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
. If you don't have a project set up, you can create one using the following commands:

### Creating a React Project

```bash
npx create-react-app my-project
cd my-project
```

### Creating a Next.js Project

```bash
npx create-next-app my-next-project
cd my-next-project
```

---

## 2. Tailwind CSS (Recommended)

While Princey UI can be used with any styling solution, we recommend using Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach. To add Tailwind CSS to your project, follow these steps:

### Installing Tailwind CSS

#### For React

1. **Install [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) CSS and its dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

2. **Configure Tailwind in `tailwind.config.js`:**

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   };
   ```

3. **Add Tailwind's styles to your CSS file:**

   In `src/index.css`:

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

#### For Next.js

1. **Install [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) CSS and its dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

2. **Configure Tailwind in `tailwind.config.js`:**

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
       "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   };
   ```

3. **Add Tailwind's styles to your CSS file:**

   In `styles/globals.css`:

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

---

## 3. Package Manager

Princey UI can be installed using any package manager, such as
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [bun](https://bunpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

```sh npm2yarn
npm install princey
```

---

## 4. Optional: React Icons

Some components in Princey UI may use icons from the [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) library. To include these icons, you can install `react-icons` as follows:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install react-icons
```

You can then use the icons like this:

```tsx
import { FaCoffee } from "react-icons/fa";

function IconExample() {
  return <FaCoffee />;
}
```

---

## 5. Additional Requirements

- **React Version:** Ensure your project uses React 18.x or higher, as Princey UI relies on React hooks.
- **TypeScript (Optional):** Princey UI supports TypeScript. You can set up TypeScript in your project if needed.

### Adding Animations

To enhance your Nextra documentation with animations, you can integrate animations using CSS, Tailwind CSS, or JavaScript libraries like [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).

#### Example with Tailwind CSS

You can add Tailwind CSS animations to buttons or other elements:

```html
<button
  class="px-4 py-2 font-bold text-white transition duration-300 ease-in-out transform bg-blue-500 rounded hover:bg-blue-700 hover:-translate-y-1 hover:scale-110"
>
  Get Started
</button>
```

#### Example with Framer Motion

For more complex animations, you can use Framer Motion:

```tsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

const FadeInButton = () => (
  <motion.button
    whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}
    whileTap={{ scale: 0.9 }}
    className="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"
  >
    Get Started
  </motion.button>
);
```

By following these guidelines, you can create a dynamic and engaging documentation site for **Princey UI** using Nextra, Tailwind CSS, and additional animation techniques.
